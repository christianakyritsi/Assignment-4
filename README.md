Comment from Dina:
# The mean, median, and minimum value in variable growth shows that the group "equal to 0" have bigger number than in the group "more than 0". There is also a value with a negative sign in the group "more than 0". The number of value in variable rgdp60 is significantly way bigger than the value in variable growth.
